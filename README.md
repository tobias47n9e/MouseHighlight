# Mouse Highlight

This is an early prototype of a mouse cursor highlighting extension for Gnome desktop that works with Wayland and X. Mouse cursor highlighting is used for screencast to make it easier for the viewer to follow the UI interactions.

# Current Status

The extension is usable but currently only draw a black point that follows the cursor. It only works if no other windows are below the canvas.

# Contributing

Any kind of contribution is welcome.
